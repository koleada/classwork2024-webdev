Vue is only used in the CLIENT folder!! as far as Vue is concerned the client folder is the root. This is because Vue is a client side 
framework. 

Server will basically be our node enviorment. However, the node package and stuff is located in the root folder for the server. 

We will use a <RouterLink> tag in place of a <a> tag anytime we are linking to a relavtive path eg one we created in our project.

In our src folder, the assets folder will hold any other files we want to go through the vite processing (eg vite will include it in our 
site) This is where well put images or other things like that. 

the scoped attribute is used in style tags to make it so those styles only affect that particular page. 

** note we will delete our components in the assignments folder but can refer back to the ones in the classwork folder**

we can define custom things within our components by defineing "prop" (at the top of the component file) and using {{ }} within the html
tags where we want the property to go. We must reference the property name in the {{ }} tempalte tags to specifify what we want. A good 
example of this is in the helloworld component.

To delete a component we must also delete the tags that reference it  in any other files. 

****** Views vs. Componenets: components are things that we use in other pages. Views are top level stand alone pages. Componenets are essentially
peices of these pages that get reused. Otherwise there is no difference between these 2. Must have these correct for final proj ******* 

Vue uses custom tags to use compentents in our views. We can reference TheWelcomeView or just the App.vue along with the helloworld component
to see this. We can also put other tags within our component tags and the components can actually use the html we supplied. To provide 
content to a componetn we use <slot></slot> tags. The content we put in the custom component tags in our view will then we displayed in 
the slot tags. Of course the reverse is true too. We can put components in or views as mentioned earlier.

** ALWAYS CHECK WHAT DIR WERE IN BEFORE ISSUING COMMANDS -- espeically when we want to do stuff for the client folder. We dont want to accidnentlu
install packages to our server (root) package.json by acciendent.
