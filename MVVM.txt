Today we will learn about making dynamic pages with JS. These can still be easily deployed to pages because only the client side is dynamic.

We will go over Vue for adding JS. 

MCV - Model View Controller - many variations on the last word eg MVP p=presentation so we will often see MV* to denote the variations 
Model = data, system/rules meaning what the system actually does at a high level eg. in a bank app u cant spend more than is in ur account. or a database
Controller = outside actions, what actions users can take upon our model. controller the user input. eg apis to handle user data. 
presentation = how our stuff is presented to the user. ex javascript running client side well be using Vue for this 

Vue uses MVVM - Model View View Model 

** always use Vue composition API 

** also we should generally put script links at the bottom of our html

**Vue is also a templating engine. It give us global variables and functions we can use in our code. & offers a templating lnaguage to be 
used in our scripts as well.
